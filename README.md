# VibeBand â€“ Wearable Doorbell Notification System

VibeBand is a simple and effective wearable device that alerts users through vibration when someone rings the doorbell. It is designed primarily to assist individuals with hearing impairments, allowing them to receive doorbell notifications in real time without relying on sound.

## Features

- Vibrates instantly when the doorbell is pressed
- Wireless communication between doorbell and wristband
- Comfortable and lightweight to wear
- Easy to set up and use
- Battery-powered for portability

## How It Works

1. A transmitter module is connected to the doorbell.
2. When the doorbell is pressed, the transmitter sends a wireless signal.
3. The wearable wristband receives the signal and activates the vibration motor.
4. The user feels the vibration and knows someone is at the door.

## Components Used

- Microcontroller (e.g., ESP8266, ATtiny85)
- RF Transmitter and Receiver modules (or other wireless tech)
- Vibration motor (coin or pager type)
- Power supply (e.g., lithium battery or AAA)
- Push button (for simulating doorbell press during testing)
- Optional: LED screen for displaying the triggered alert

## Getting Started

1. Upload the code to both transmitter and receiver microcontrollers.
2. Power up both units and test the connection using the doorbell button.
3. When the button is pressed, the wristband should vibrate for a few seconds.
4. Fine-tune the range and timing as needed for your specific setup.
